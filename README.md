# Drowning
An acrtionscript game I made in 2014. Exploration and story based game that is procedurally generated. Needs Flash Player to run.

I made it when starting out game development on the side, during my Bachelors degree made using the Starling framework using ActionScript. 

The player controlled a ship in a procedurally generated 2D ocean, where he has to save animals while defeating the enemies known as the drowned. Things are not as simple as they seem as there are 2 possible storylines depending on how much the player tries to understand the drowned.

The game took _6 months and was a solo effort_ to make and had:
- 5 different kinds of enemies
- 5 different kinds of creatures to save using a portal
- 12 upgrades
- 3 special powers
- 5 collectable weapons
- 2 storylines depending on how much the player harvests the enemies and how many creatures he saved

## Gameplay
With the player getting only one chance to finish the entire game. The game has permadeath and needs to be played completely in one play through. Leaving the game resets your character. 

There is a health and energy system (Represented by the green and red bar on the upper left). If either runs out, you will die. Both can be replenished by heading back to the mother ship. All movement and special powers cost energy.

If you're low on energy or health, press L to eject and the penalty for energy is removed. Find your way back to the mother ship and the ship will rebuild around you.
